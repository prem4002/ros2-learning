16th October
On simulation
- model for the container?
- MoveIt container
	- Reachability analysis
- link1, 2, 3 analysis
- plant, cylinder - optimize
Holes in the cyclinder, Variable size for the robot, which size would be optimial fro the robot - with experimentation

1 Dec
- [x] Set proper coordinates for the robot
- [x] moveit background

8 Dec
- [x] create multiple configurations for the bot
- [x] create stl file for the 30L container

22 Dec
- [ ] run reachability analysis for the two new configurations created
- [ ] IK solver computation power
- [ ] Figure out how collision check will happen with agitator
- [ ] document why a robot with prismatic arm will be required and industry robots or full revolute arms won't be able to reach all of the container
