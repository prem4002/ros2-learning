Reactor geometry
- cylindrical tank?
- Horizontal/Vertical?
- with baffles, pipes, agitator shaft?

generic
- cylinder
- hemisphere bottom

robotic arm
- 6dof industrial arm UR5/UR10, KUKA KR
- Tool length
- Monting location
don't have my own arm yet, reference urdf

What should be found in reachability analysis
- can the arm reach x, y and z
- which angle is required for the nozzle
- can it reach places without collisions

to do:
to define the environment (reactor) in cad
robot model
compute FK/IK (ros move it)
reachability mapping


What is swab collection
